# PluginTemplate

This is a template for a Minecraft plugin written in Java.

To get started, click the "Use this template" button in the top-right corner of this page. Then, select "Create a new repository." After you have created the repository, start by changing the folders in src/main/java to match your domain name and plugin name. For example, if my domain was `example.com` and my plugin was named "epicplugin" the directory structure inside of src/main/java would be com/example/epicplugin. Next, go into the `plugin.java` file and change the package line to match the directory structure seperated by dots. Following the preceding example, this would look like:

```java
package com.example.epicplugin;
```

Finally, go into src/main/resources/plugin.yml and change the fields there.
